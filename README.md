# Analisa-Capres-2024
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The code analysis presented here is not intended for malicious purposes but is solely created for my personal learning.

About Method
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Method that i use for this project is Naive Bayes Classifier. 

*Why Naive Bayes?*

Naive Bayes was chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in various scenarios. The algorithm is easy to implement, especially for educational purposes, and performs well even with relatively small datasets. Its efficiency with large datasets and high-dimensional features makes it a suitable choice for classification tasks. Additionally, Naive Bayes is particularly well-suited for text classification, which might be relevant in the context of analyzing presidential candidates for the year 2024. The algorithm's ease of use, minimal hyperparameter tuning, and ability to handle multiple classes contribute to its popularity in various applications.

Requirement for Implementations
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirement yang dibutuhkan adalah sebagai berikut:
- Data from Crawling X (twitter) Comments since the beginning of the 2024 presidential election
- Pandas Package
- Regular Expression (REGEX) Package
- Matplotlib Package
- Sastrawi Package
- Etc.
